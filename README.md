# Pharticula

A minimalist physics-based particle visualization created with Matter.js.

## Overview

Pharticula creates an interactive physics simulation with a central node and orbiting particles. The particles are influenced by forces of attraction to the center and repulsion from each other, creating a dynamic, self-organizing system.

## Features

- Center node can be dragged with mouse interaction
- Particles automatically reposition based on physics forces
- Adjustable parameters via control panel:
  - Center mass and friction
  - Node count and size
  - Orbit radius
  - Attraction and repulsion forces
  - Node repulsion field size
  - Node friction
  - Connection stiffness
- Debug visualization mode
- Responsive design
- Optimized performance

## Technologies

- HTML5 Canvas
- Matter.js Physics Engine
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser to run the simulation. Use the control panel to adjust parameters and see how they affect the physics.
